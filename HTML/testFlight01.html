    <b>Objective:</b> SN8 aimed to demonstrate the aerodynamic control of the Starship spacecraft during ascent and descent, as well as test the performance of the newly developed Raptor engines.

    <b>Date and Location:</b> The test flight took place on December 9, 2020, from SpaceX's South Texas launch site.
    
    <b>Achievements:</b>
    
    <b>Ascent: </b> SN8 successfully ascended to an altitude of approximately 12.5 kilometers (41,000 feet).
    <b>Maneuvers:</b> Demonstrated controlled aerodynamic maneuvers during ascent.
    <b>Descent:</b> Initiated a controlled descent phase to test aerodynamic control.
    <b>Raptor Engines:</b> Tested the performance of the newly developed Raptor engines.
    
    <b>Outcome:</b>
    
    <b>Partial Success:</b> While the test achieved several key objectives, one of the Raptor engines failed to reignite properly during the landing phase.
    <b>Hard Landing:</b> This resulted in a hard landing, causing SN8 to crash into the landing pad at high speed and explode upon impact.
    <b>Data Collection:</b> Despite the explosive landing, the test flight provided valuable data for SpaceX engineers, helping to inform future iterations of the Starship design.
    
 <b>   Significance:</b> The test demonstrated significant progress towards SpaceX's goal of developing a fully reusable spacecraft capable of carrying humans and cargo to destinations such as the Moon, Mars, and beyond.
